        <p class="des">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The changes in the composition of the atmosphere can cause a lot of climate challenges. One of the major reasons for changes in the composition of the atmosphere is the high amount of greenhouse gas emissions.
            The main sources of greenhouse gas emissions are vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel. They release a lot of amount of carbon dioxide that severely causes the overall increase of global warming.
            As well as, the emission of Nitrogen dioxide and methane gasses from various industrial processes like manufacturing and chemical production. Moreover, agricultural activities contribute to greenhouse gas emissions primarily through livestock digestion by releasing methane and Nitrous oxide.  
        </p>
        <p class="des">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, deforestation is also a major reason for the high greenhouse gas percentage in the atmosphere because trees act as carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 during photosynthesis. 
            Deforestation not only releases stored carbon but also reduces the planet's ability to mitigate climate change.

        <h2 id="topic2">How do climate change affect humankind</h2>
        <img src="images/health_impacts.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="des">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to the 2030 Agenda, chapter 4 of paragraph 38 of Johannesburg Plan of Implementation expresses the concern of Member States for the changes occurring in the Earth’s climate
            and the adverse effects these have on humankind such as various health risks incuding heart related illnesses, respiratory diseases due to air pollution.
            Moreover changes in precipitation patterns and melting glaciers can lead to water scarcity in many regions. 
            In addition, climate change affects agricultural productivity through changes in temperature, precipitation, and the frequency of extreme weather events. 
        </p>
        <p class="des">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Climate change contributes to the intensification and increased frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires, resulting in property damage, displacement, loss of livelihoods, and loss of life.
            As well as the long-term impacts of these can cause even economic corruption. Climate change can exacerbate existing security threats and conflicts, particularly
            in regions with scarce resources, weak governance, and socio-economic disparities, leading to migration, displacement, and instability

        <p class="des">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Nations (UN) has been actively involved in addressing climate challenges through various initiatives and agreements. 
            The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 1985 Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer as amended, 
            the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are some of examples.
        </p>
        <p class="des">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, they have emphasized the actions they can promote to prepare and identify a climate challenge such as,
            <ol>
                <li> Advancing systematic observations of the Earth’s atmosphere, land, and oceans by improving monitoring stations</li>
                <li> Increasing the use of satellites and appropriate integration of these observations to produce high-quality data</li>
                <li> Enhancing the implementation of national, regional, and international strategies to monitor the Earth’s atmosphere, land, and oceans</li>
            </ol>
        <p>    
        There are so many other sessions held by the United Nations to discuss clusters of thematic issues related to sustainable development. <br>The Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) 14th session in 2006 and 15th session in 2007 are the main examples of that.</br><br>During these sessions, they discussed these challenges shared best practices, and formulated policy recommendations to address issues related to </br>air quality and its impacts on Sustainable Development.
