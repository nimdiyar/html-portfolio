    <p>Our climate is warming quickly, according to research. Since 1880, there has been an average worldwide temperature increase of 1.2 degrees Celsius, with the late 20th century seeing the largest increase. 
      The amount of atmospheric CO2, a greenhouse gas that is responsible for over two thirds of global warming, is at an all-time high. 
      The warming of the atmosphere, ocean, and land due to human activity has resulted in extensive and swift changes to the cryosphere, biosphere, atmosphere, and ocean, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has consistently noted.
       Nearly the past 50 years, the frequency of weather, climate, and water-related disasters has grown by a factor of five due to these climatic changes, resulting in nearly 2 million deaths and losses of US$3.64 trillion.
      </p>
    <p>The IPCC warns that global warming of more than 1.5 degrees could have unavoidable and irreversible effects.
      On the other hand, equitable and successful adaptation and mitigation strategies can greatly lower vulnerability and increase climate resilience. 
      In order to ensure that global warming stays well below 2 degrees Celsius, and ideally stays at 1.5 degrees Celsius, above pre-industrial levels, nations united to obligate themselves through the Paris Agreement. 
      Being the first legally binding pact in the history of climate action, the accord represents a significant turning point in global collaboration to combat climate change.
    </p> 
    <p>Targeted initiatives that have real advantages and minimise trade-offs on several fronts are essential for achieving shared success in the fight against climate change if we are to move quickly in this race. 
      Climate change is directly related to the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which represent the global action plan for achieving sustainability and resilience for people and the planet. 
      By utilising the Climate and SDG Synergies to maximise the connections between the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement, it is possible to accomplish both goals and ensure that no one is left behind, therefore ensuring a future that can be lived in.
      The achievement of many other SDGs, including those pertaining to poverty, hunger, access to water, and terrestrial and marine ecosystems, would actually be made much easier with progress achieved towards reducing the increase in global temperature. 
      Many of the SDGs and their targets, such as those pertaining to resilience in SDGs 9 and 11, which deal with infrastructure and urban settlements, respectively, can also be met in a way that would allow for adaptive responses to climate change.
